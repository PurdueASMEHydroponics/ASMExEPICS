Any new files needing to be saved should be saved in the TEMPORARY FILES directory in their own directory. 

You can do this by clicking on the directory, and hitting the upload file button from there. In order to create a new directory for the file, when naming the file type the new directory name followed by a forward slash "/" then the new file name.

If the new Full Code file requires more libraries, update the LIBRARIES LIST file.

Keep the github organized please.
